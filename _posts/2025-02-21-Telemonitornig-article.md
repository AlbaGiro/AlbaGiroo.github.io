## Telemonitoring

I would love to share with you the article I wrote recently about my [telemonitoring project](https://www.fullsdenginyeria.cat/cap-la-telemedicina-davantguarda-monitoritzacio-continua-domicili-pacients-cronics-complexos-i). Where described a new telemonitoring tool adapted for chronic, complex, and palliative pediatric care.

## SEPIH 24

I recently presented the digital transformation of chronic, complex, and palliative pediatric care at the [SEPIH congress](https://sepih.es/viii-reunion-sepih-en-octubre-de-2024/). I shared its limitations, but also the path we still need to walk.
I truly believe in technology and data science to improve healthcare, ensuring patient safety and quality of life."
